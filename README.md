#INTRODUCTION
video-dl is a script to download videos from youtube and some other sites.

#USAGE
There are 2 scripts.
1) video-dl:	video-dl $url	OR	video-dl $website $id
2) grab-url:	somehow activate the script keeping your browser focused. (Tray icon or Hotkeys)

#SUPPORTED SITES
Currently, the supported sites are-
tubemotion, flashx.tv, facebook videos (in grab-url), tahuko.com (a Gujarati songs website) and all supported sites of your youtube-dl (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/)

#DESCRIPTION
For the time being, I have just made a rude script, but as and when time permits, I am looking to port them to python similar to youtube-dl.
No other tools required except python and bash.
Feel free to add your own patches for the sites you like.
